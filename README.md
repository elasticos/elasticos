### ElasticOS-Kernel

***

The future development direction of underlying ElasticOS includes the following aspects:

**Enhanced Security**: With the increase in network threats and security vulnerabilities, future operating systems will focus more on security. This may include stronger isolation and security protection mechanisms, as well as stricter permission control and authentication.

**Cloud and Edge Computing Support**: Future operating systems will better integrate the capabilities of cloud computing and edge computing. This means that the operating systems need to have better network connectivity and data transmission capabilities to support distributed computing and storage.

**Cross-Platform and Compatibility**: With the proliferation of multiple devices and operating systems, future operating systems will emphasize cross-platform and compatibility. This means that the operating systems need to provide a consistent user experience and be able to seamlessly communicate and integrate with other operating systems and devices.

**Automation and Intelligence**: Future operating systems may become more automated and intelligent by incorporating machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies. They can automatically optimize system configurations, schedule tasks, and manage resources, providing more efficient and intelligent operating system experiences.

**Containerization and Virtualization Support**: With the widespread adoption of containerization and virtualization technologies, future operating systems will better support these technologies, providing more efficient container and virtual machine management capabilities, as well as better resource isolation and management mechanisms.

In summary, future ElasticOS will continue to evolve and adapt to changing technological and application requirements, providing more secure, efficient, intelligent, and scalable computing environments.
